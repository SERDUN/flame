/// - the night: the view covered with [ambient] at [darkness], every
///   [LightSource] cutting its shape out of that dark with a soft falloff;
/// - the light cast: each light's colour added on top at [glow], so a lamp
///   both reveals the street under it and warms it;
/// - the glow: every [Emissive] part of the world (bulbs, lit windows, the
///   halo [haze] makes round them) drawn over the night undimmed, and then
///   given to every [LightMirror] (water, a wet road) to show mirrored as it
///   shows anything - ripples bend it, a rough wet road smears it long.
///
/// The night and the light cast are blend modes and gradients in one layer,
/// so they work on every renderer, the web included.
///

/// should shine in the lamps' light can draw itself there, as bright as
